- [Tyler Goelz](http://github.com/chaboi)
- [Avi Haiat](http://github.com/thaiat)

## General notes

- In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style 
- Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.
- Lint and test your code using [gulp lint](http://gulpjs.com/).

## Test your changes to the generator's functionality

Inside your local clones' folders, finish off your changes and then run

```sh
npm link
```

Make sure you do an `npm link` there ***before*** running the command in your `generator-makeme-famous` folder, if you are testing both.

This replaces your global versions of `generator-makeme-famous` and/or `generator-sublime` with symbolic links to your local clones of the generators.

Once this is done, create a folder for a new project somewhere on your system, e.g. `~/my-makeme-famous-projects/test-makeme-famous`, and `cd` into it. Inside run makeme-famous with
```sh
yo makeme-famous
```
and have the generator run. 

>If errors occur during the npm install in your new project, mark down which dependencies need to be upgraded or changed. A `.gulps-package.json` file will be created. Copy the `devDependencies` object from this file, paste it in your project's `package.json` file, change the versions or dependencies as needed, and then run `npm install`.

Next scaffold a module with a controller
```sh
yo makeme-famous:module common
yo makeme-famous:controller common home
```

Then run lint & karma, everything should pass. 
```sh
gulp lint
gulp karma
```

Make sure you also test the functionality you added to make sure it does what you intended. Please put this project in a public repo and link to it in your PR so we can check out the results.

Finally don't forget to unlink and re-install the generators from npm by running
```sh
npm uninstall -g generator-sublime generator-makeme-famous
npm install -g generator-sublime generator-makeme-famous
```

And please:

### Always run `npm test` before sending a PR
> This will also run `gulp lint`
